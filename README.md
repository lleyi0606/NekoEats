### Main objective
Guide users in achieving a balanced diet and build healthy eating habits over time.

### Motivation
Obesity and diabetes rates have been on the high due to unhealthy eating habits, it would be helpful to help people tackle this problem with the help of a health app
* Existing health app are calorie-based which could be a trigger 
* Requires more effort as user logs in their meal manually 
* Struggle with deciding what to eat all the time 

### Target Audience
If you are someone who wishes to improve your health, set your own goals and monitor them, this app is for you! 

## Technologies Used 
This app was built primarily with React Native, an open-source UI software framework. 

The database has been deployed on Firebase, utilising its Authentication, Firestore and Realtime Database features. 

Meal data are fetched from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), empowering us to allow users to simply key in names of food when they wish to log it! _It would be unfeasible to manually log in 21g of protein and 30g of fats :(_

** Note: The API keys and access keys for the above mentioned are not being actively maintained currently. Hence, this app is not currently workable.
